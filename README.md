## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

> ‚úÖ Recommended to run this on a **local machine with GUI (Windows/Linux/Mac)** for full functionality.

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Smart-Personal-Assistant.git
cd Smart-Personal-Assistant
```

### 2. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended)

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Add your OpenAI API key

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

Or directly replace `"your_openai_api_key"` in `llm.py` (not recommended for production).

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the App

```bash
python gui.py
```

A GUI window will open. You can enter commands like:

* `"Increase volume"`
* `"Take a screenshot"`
* `"Search for Python tutorials"`
* `"Open a Word project"`
